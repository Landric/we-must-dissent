	<h1>CONFIDENTIAL THREAT REPORT - P.S.S.D.F PERSONNEL ONLY</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>DESIGNATION: "The Community"</h2>
	<h3>RISK LEVEL: <strong class="very-low">VERY LOW</strong></h3>
	<p>This group follows little more than a promise granted by a delusional con-man enslaved by his own computerised ego. His charisma has garnered the support and followers that he has needed to start elsewhere, though this appears to be less an act of direct treason and more an attempt to leave unnoticed. The precise reasons for this are, as yet, unknown.</p>
	<p>Vasser has significant access to advanced technology in the form of the neuronic enhancements he himself utilises. However, more detailed threat reports indicate that bar cybernetic enslavement and mental control, this cannot be used to create a direct threat to Phoenix or its people. As a result, the so-called "Community" can be considered a presently-negligible threat.</p>
	<p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong> Medical scientists still loyal to Phoenix have expressed an interest in recovery of the neuronic enhancement prototypes if at all possible. To ensure continuing co-operation from our remaining specialists, we will acquiesce to this request. Vasser, or any individual believed to be in possession of aforementioned cybernetic modules, is to be either taken in for questioning or subdued for enhancement extraction.</p>
